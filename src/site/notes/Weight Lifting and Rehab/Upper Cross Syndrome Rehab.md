# Upper Cross Syndrome
- Tight (overactive) upper traps and levator scapula muscles
- Tight pecs
- Neck flexors on the front side and the rhomboids and lower traps on the back are lengthened and inhibited
- You need stretch the tight (overactive) muscles and strengthen the weak (underactive) muscles. The chest muscles and the upper traps need to be stretched.

# Proper Posture
![[Upper Cross Syndrome Stretches and Strengthening.pdf#page=4]]

# Increase Ab Strength
- Planks (1+ min)
- Leg raise
- Reverse crunch

# Neck Flexors
- **Deep Neck Flexor Muscle Strengthening:** Laying flat on your back, try to lift your head off the mat keeping your chin tucked back, and hold your head just 1cm above the mat. Hold for 15 sec reps (x4), trying not to jut your chin. If you notice shaking from the muscles, then there is some deep neck flexor muscle fatigue and will need to work on this 1-2x/day.
- Chink tuck

# Strengthen Lower Traps + Scapular Muscles
- Farmers Walk
- Good Mornings
- Chin Up
- Bent Over Barbell Row
- Deadlift

# Stretching Upper Traps
- **Upper Trap + Levator Scapulae muscle stretch**: Stand in place with good posture. Draw navel inward. Retract and depress scapula on the side being stretched. Tuck chin and slowly flex head to one side, pulling one ear toward the same shoulder. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds. Switch sides. Perform 1-2 sets each side twice a day.
- Shoulder Rolls
- Upper Trap Head Tilts
- Massage Ball Stretches
	- Don’t roll over bony areas e.g. shoulder blades or spine – you should be rolling through the trapezius muscle.
