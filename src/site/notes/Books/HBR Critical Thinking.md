# HBR Critical Thinking

## Goals
Learn to
- consider other views
- tolerate
- differentiating relevant/irrelevant info

## Mindset
- Avoid setting up false state of urgency
	- Manage emotions to stay clear headed 
	- But too deliberative/slow can get you caught flat-footed
	- Manage balance
- Bring focus to right priorities
	- Don't spend too much time focusing on less important work because we enjoy it or are good at it
- Deliberately approach each problem
	- Don't jump to conclusions (requires focus to read/apprehend the question entirely)
- WTF: wishful thinking forever blinded by optimism
	- Always question your approach
	- "What if?" 
- Expand horizon by interacting with people not in your existing silo
## Act Like a Scientist
- Be a knowledgeable skeptic
- Don't let biases/errors get in the way of finding the truth
- Question assumptions
	- Trust but confirm
- Investigate anomalies
- Articulate testable hypotheses
	- Experiments that produce evidence contradicting a hypothesis allows us tao recognize errors in our thinking
	- Modify the hypothesis and retest
	- This iterative process of testing/refining leads to stronger hypotheses
- Produce hard evidence
- Probe cause and effect
	- Change one or more variables (the presumed cause) and observe changes in the outcome(effect) while holding all other variables constant
	- When they can't keep all other variables constant, they rely on randomization, which prevents systemic bias (introduced consciously or unconsciously)
	
## Observe situation
- Identify assumptions/biases
- Break them down and reach a broader view
	- View too granular or missing details by focusing too broadly
## Ask Questions

## Seek Differing Perspectives

## Analyze Information
