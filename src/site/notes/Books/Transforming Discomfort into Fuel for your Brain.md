# Transforming Discomfort into Fuel for your Brain

## Change the Way You Think
- "I can do hard things."
- Recognize the discomfort as an **expectable reaction** to doing a hard thing.
- It's not a signal that something is wrong and that you need to ease up
- Replace "this hurts, I wan't to stop" with "I can do hard things" and "Embrace it, figure it out." 

## Power of Changing Labels
- Think of anxiety/nervousness as excitement
- Channel the nervousness into energy to propel you through the task

## Process
1. Think about the next "I can't do this" barriers that you are most likely to hit. Where will you be and what will you be doing?
2. Brainstorm ways to give yourself visual cues for what you want to replace those negative thoughts with
	- Post it notes on desk: "You can do hard things"
3. Set the cue. Write the note and post it on your desk.
