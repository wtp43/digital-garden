# HBR on Lifelong Learning

## Learning to Learn
> The ability to learn faster than your competitors may be the only sustainable competitive advantage - Arie de Geus
- Resist bias against doing new things, scanning the horizon for growth opportunities, and pushing yourself to acquire radically different capabilities - while still performing your job
### Important Attributes
#### Aspiration
- Raising aspiration
	- Notice resistance (negative thoughts unconsciously reinforcing lack of aspiration) to development that is critical to success and adjust
		- IE: It will take too long, the old way works for me
	- Envision reaping the rewards
#### Self-awareness
- Start by accepting that your perspective is often biased or flawed and the strive for greater objectivity
	- Leaves you more open to hearing/acting on others' opinions
	- Pay attention to how you talk to yourself about yourself and question the validity of the "self-talk"
	- Don't be too defensive
		- Inner voice should act as a "fair witness"
- Changing inner narrative
	- I don't need to learn this -> What would my future look like if I did?
	- I'm already fine at this -> Am I really? How do I compare?
	- This is boring -> I wonder why others find it interesting?
	- I'm terrible at this -> I'm making beginner mistakes, but I'll get better
#### Curiosity
- Do not focus on and reinforce initial disinterest in an unfamiliar/hard subject
- Ask curious questions and follow up with actions
- How can I work differently to make it more interesting
	- This is boring -> I wonder if I could...?
#### Vulnerability
- Great learnings allow themselves to be vulnerable enough to accept being back at the beginner state
	- Become reasonably comfortable in it by managing your self talk
- I hate this, I suck at this, I'm so behind -> I'm going to be bad at this to start with, because I've never done it before and I know I can learn to do it over time
