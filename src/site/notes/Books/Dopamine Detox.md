# Dopamine Detox

Desire Currency: Dopamine makes us want to seek and want new things that we don't currently own. 
Energy Currency: Epinephrine (created by dopamine) gives us adrenaline

# Spiking Dopamine
**Sense the craving as its own form of pleasure. Seek the pursuit and not the reward**
- Attaching dopamine to the reward is dangerous as it can lead to dopamine reward prediction error. 
	- This can lower your baseline dopamine especially if the reward was not as great as you expected
	- Lowers motivation
- Tap dopamine as a motivator
- Expect postpartum depression after a dopamine spike. Expecting it can be helpful in mitigating the downside of the reward prediction error 
	- Don't raise expectations too high
- The amount of pleasure you experience is directly related to how much pain you experience
	-  Pain evokes dopamine release 
		- Dopamine after ice bath/anything uncomfortable

# Regulating Yourself
**Pleasure experienced without prior requirement for pursuit is terrible for motivation**
- Addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure
- A good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure and includes pleasure through motivation and hard work
- Understanding the pain pleasure balance whereby if you experience pain and you continue to be in that friction and exert effort, the rewards are that much greater when they arrive
- Avoid free dopamine (social media, tv shows)
	- The amount of context switches in scrolling social media destroys your ability to self regulate
	- Especially in the morning (avoid cellphone for the first hour in the morning)

# What Dopamine Actually Does
- Blinking is related to conception of time
	- Blink more
- Low dopamine tends to overestimate amount of time

# How to Destroy Your Brain
- Bright light exposure from 10pm to 4am
	- Bright light blocks the release of dopamine through a pathway

# Importance of Sleep
- Neuro-plasticity(reshaping of your brain) occurs during sleep
	- It's triggered in wakefulness but it actually takes place in sleep
	- When you wake up in the morning, you are in a perfect position to receive the download of all the work that your neural circuity has been doing the night before  
	- If you immediately go to a rich sensory experience of stuff, you are missing the information of the stuff you processed at night
	- Prevent taking information in early during the day to receive ideas from the learning that your brain did during your sleep

> [!info]+ What is stage 2 NREM sleep?
> Stage 2 is still light sleep, but deeper than stage 1. During this stage, your brain waves slow down and have noticeable pauses between short, powerful bursts of electrical activity. Experts think those bursts are your brain organizing memories and information from the time you spent awake.
> 
>Stage 2 NREM sleep accounts for about 45% of your time asleep (the most of any stage). Youâ€™ll go through multiple rounds of stage 2 NREM sleep, and usually, each one is longer than the last. After stage 2, you move deeper into stage 3 NREM sleep or enter REM sleep.

- The peak in our alertness is actually 90 mins before our natural bedtime
- Go to bed earlier If you struggle to go back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night
	- This is a sign that your melatonin is starting to get released early in the evening
	- This is caused by our natural  adaptive ability to push and stay up later if we really need to

# Action Based Denial
- Daily 25 No Goes
	- Keeps our no go circuitry tuned up
	- Actively refrain from impulsively doing something
	- Prevent unnecessary/meaningless actions/triggers from taking away your dopamine
		- For example: bad drivers, dumb comments online are examples of open dopamine loops waiting for your to respond. Any retaliation/response will give you that dopamine response of success. The no response actually drops their dopamine below baseline dopamine. Anything that short-circuits the kind of madness of getting pulled into some (online) battle that's totally meaningless takes people away from other powerful good things that they can 
# Process
1. Goals
2. Rules (belief in that the rules will help you achieve your goals that they become part of your identity)
3. Pain -> Pleasure Loop
	- Don't constantly press the gas pedal, learn to lean back and relax to balance and not burn out

# Conclusion
Key: To pursue rewards but understand that the pursuit is actually the reward
- Don't be afraid of the difficulties you'll run into
- Actively pursue these challenges by not being afraid but curious
- This means that the celebration must be less than the pursuit
Goal: Become good at attaching dopamine to something you don't want to do by associating dopamine with pursuit and not reward

Amplifier for the Pursuit of More Dopamine: Understand that the more friction and pain you experience , the greater the dopamine reward you will get later on.
