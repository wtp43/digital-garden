# Description
Make a deep copy of a linked list where each node has an extra pointer to another node.
# Brute Force

# Implementation
```python
def copyRandomList(self, head: "Node") -> "Node":
        oldToCopy = {None: None}
        cur = head
        while cur:
            copy = Node(cur.val)
            oldToCopy[cur] = copy
            cur = cur.next
        cur = head
        while cur:
            copy = oldToCopy[cur]
            copy.next = oldToCopy[cur.next]
            copy.random = oldToCopy[cur.random]
            cur = cur.next
        return oldToCopy[head]
```

We can use O(n) space to store all the new nodes in a dictionary. Then we don't need O(n) traversals per node to find the random.
